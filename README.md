# european-soccer-database
An investigation on the overall performance of soccer teams.

This soccer database comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. The database is stored in a SQLite database.

In my investigation using SQL Queries and Python, I will pose three research questions, try to answer them, and finally come up with conclusions. My research questions will be:
1. What teams experienced a significant improvement or fell over the period?
2. What team attributes lead to the most victories?
3. Which players had the most penalties?
